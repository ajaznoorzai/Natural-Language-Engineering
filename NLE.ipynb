        "It is not possible to evaluate a classifier effectively by focusing simply on accuracy. Accuracy is not always reliable and be misleading.The further you get from 50/50, the more accuracy misleads. For instance, a model can predict the value of the majority class for all predictions and obtain a high classification accuracy in a problem with a significant class imbalance. Additional performance metrics, such as the F1 score and Brier score, are therefore required. So, further performance measures are needed such as F1 score, precistion Recall.\n",

Another example When classes are unbalanced, evaluating classifiers in terms of accuracy can be misleading.  For example, if 10% of documents are relevant and 90% of documents are irrelevant, then a classifier which labels all documents as irrelevant will obtain an accuracy of 90%.  This sounds good but is actually useless. More useful metrics for evaluation of performance are precision, recall and F1 score.  These metrics allow us to distinguish the different types of errors our classifiers make."

However, the Wordlist classifier was better at predicting negatively labelled movie reviews, but had a significantly higher total number of incorrectly predicted reviews. In terms of the above metrics, the Naive Bayes classifier outperformed the Wordlist classifier in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n"

        "5) \n",
        "a) Design and **carry out an experiment** into the impact of the **length of the wordlists** on the wordlist classifier.  Make sure you **describe** design decisions in your experiment, include a **graph** of your results and **discuss** your conclusions. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans 5 (a)\n",
        "* From the above graphs, it can be seen that as the length of the wordlists increases, the classifier initially reaches a peak accuracy peak of almost 62%, after which the accuracy decreases. This is due to the fact that when the classifier is trained, the words of the two classes \"pos\" and \"neg\" overlap. When a larger number of frequent words are used in word list generation, the same words occur in different classes, which leads to ambiguity in predicting the output. For the same reason, the precision of the classifier also decreases (after it reaches its maximum value of 57%), as it is not able to make correct positive predictions for positively marked movie reviews \n",
        "* the recall of the classifier shows a steep increase at first, then rises slightly and remains quite stable at almost 98.5%.\n",
        "* Since the classifier has medium-low precision and high recall, the F1 score is used to measure its performance. As with all other metrics, the F1 score shows a sharp increase until it peaks at almost 72%, after which it drops steeply to 69% and then drops to 68%. Although the F1 values do not show much change, the range of variation is only 3%/4%.\n",
        "* Thus, determining the k most frequent words with which to train the classifier remains crucial and forms the backbone of the classifier. Ideally, the k value should be much smaller than the total size of the word list, since above a certain threshold, the words in both word lists start to influence each other and create ambiguity during classification. From the above diagrams, it can be seen that a k value of almost 100 would be very efficient for classification.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A wordlist classifier is a very basic classification technique that relies on the frequency of words in both negative and positive wordlists and fails to account for the relative number of words in relationship to a set of datasets, producing inaccurate metrices in many cases.\n",

        "The Naïve Bayes algorithm quickly predicts the class of the test data set. Moreover, it also performs accurately in a multi-class prediction scenario.\n",

        "\n",
        "Conclution :\n",
        "\n",
        "When we use an assumption of independence, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better than other models like WordList Classifer. It works with fewer training data too. Common applications of Naive Bayes algorithm are Google in Spam filtering of Gmail when reciving emails. Considering all the above I highly recommend Naïve Bayes Classifiers over my wordlist classifiers, while researching about different machine learning algorithms Classification, Naïve Bayes Algorithm is better than many other a classifier. It belongs to the supervised learning algorithm category and is a simple classification algorithm that improves the development of fast machine learning models capable of making quick predictions. As mentioned previously it predicts based on the probability of an object known as a probabilistic classifier."
